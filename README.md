In this project, I have used "Relative Keypoint Displacement" to animate the objects.Dataset of source images and driving videos are taken from the GitHub of AliaksandrSiarohin.Here, I have taken source image of "Mona Lisa" and driving video of "Donald Trump" (NOTE: This is only for fun purpose and for testing).  This project is done on "Google-Colab"
